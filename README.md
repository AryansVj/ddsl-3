# Digital Design and Synthesis Lab assignment
To learn and master skills to develop complex embedded systems and improve designs by using the tools available in Vivado. This also helped in understanding and utilizing advanced components of embedded systems design for architecting a complex system in the Zynq™ System on a Chip (SoC)
Completed as a part of the EE587 - Digital Desing and Synthesis in Semester 8 of the Electrical and Electronic Engineering undergraduate course in 2024.
Inspired by the github project by **xupgit** titled [Advanced-Embedded-System-Design-Flow-on-Zynq](github.com/xupgit/Advanced-Embedded-System-Design-Flow-on-Zynq/)
## Advanced Embedded System Design Flow on Zynq
### Zynq Platform
 Zynq is a development platform that intergrates the functionality of both a *Processing System (PS)* and a *Programmable Logic (PL)* into a single SoC along with a versatile GPIO interface. AMD Zynq™ 7000 SoC family integrates the software programmability of an Arm®-based processor (As the PS) with the hardware programmability of an FPGA (as the PL), enabling key analytics and hardware acceleration while integrating CPU, DSP, ASSP, and mixed signal functionality on a single device. Consisting of single-core Zynq 7000S and dual-core Zynq 7000 devices, the Zynq 7000 family offers an exceptional price to performance-per-watt, fully scalable SoC platform for your unique application requirements.

 ### Vivado Tool
 AMD Vivado™ is the design software for AMD adaptive SoCs and FPGAs. It includes a comprehensive design flow for Design Entry, Synthesis, Place and Route, Verification/Simulation tools. It can be used to write Hardware/RTL level logic and program an FPGA or a similar development environment.
